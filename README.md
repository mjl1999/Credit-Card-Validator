# Credit-Card-Validator
A credit card validator that makes use of the luhn algorithm to validate whether a credit card number input from the user is valid.

This project has a very special place in my heart.

I came to this project via a free python learning tutorial. While the base implementation of the luhn algorithm was something that the tutorial practically hand-held me through, the additional elements to this project are uniquely my own. These are demonstrated in the 'Criteria' function, which includes the "retry attempt" functionality - the alerting of the user to the correct input - and also associated functions therein. 

Originally this project forced the user to enter in the form 1234-1234-1234-1234 (with hyphens included - thus requiring a length of 19 and hyphen placement at index 4, 9 and 14 respectively) but I figured that this was too restrictive, though I do intend to add a stipulation that if the user inputs hyphens, they must be inputted correctly.

While certainly not as difficult as my attempt at coding blackjack or making a simple coffee machine, it still remains my favourite. This project was the first time I ever ventured outside the comfy confines of an online tutorial and attempted to improve upon the projects I was coding. And though it was only in my own small way, I succeeded.

It also represented a milestone for me in terms of my coding skills, as I managed to get a grip on the concept of functions and starting becoming comfortable creating and organising them for specialised tasks in my program.
